# POS-tagging-with-RNN
Implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for Part-of-Speech tagging, trained on the Universal Dependencies English Web Treebank (EWT). Includes preprocessing with tokenization and OOV handling, sequence modeling with embeddings and recurrent layers, and evaluation via tagging accuracy and confusion matrix on held-out test data.
